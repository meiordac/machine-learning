# Machine-learning
This repo includes the code for all the assignments I developed from the machine learning course by Coursera and Stanford University 

This class introduces the students to the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems.
